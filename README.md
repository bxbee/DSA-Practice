## 🚀 1. Fundamentals: Arrays & Complexity

Before diving deep, we must understand how to store basic data and measure the efficiency of our code using **Big $O$ Notation** (e.g., $O(1)$, $O(n)$, $O(\log n)$).

* **Arrays & Strings:** The bedrock of DSA. Used for sliding window and two-pointer techniques.
* **Searching:** Moving from linear search $O(n)$ to the highly efficient **Binary Search** $O(\log n)$.

## 📚 2. Linear Data Structures

Data arranged in a sequential manner. Mastering these is crucial for parsing data and managing operations.

### 🥞 Stacks
A **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** structure. If you are preparing for quizzes or technical rounds, Stacks are heavily tested! They are essential for:
* Reversing strings
* Validating parentheses in code
* Undo operations in text editors
* Evaluating expressions (Prefix/Postfix)



### 🚶 Queues & Linked Lists
* **Queues (FIFO):** First-In, First-Out. Perfect for scheduling tasks and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
* **Linked Lists:** Nodes connected by pointers. Excellent for dynamic memory allocation where the size isn't known upfront.

## 🌳 3. Non-Linear Data Structures

When data isn't sequential, we use hierarchical and networked structures.

### Trees
Data organized in parent-child relationships. 
* **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Keeps data sorted for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.

### Graphs
Nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Used for mapping networks, finding shortest paths (like Google Maps), and social network connections.

## ⚙️ 4. Advanced Algorithms & CP 

This is where the magic happens for competitive programming rounds on platforms like **CodeChef** and **Codeforces**.

### 🧩 Dynamic Programming (DP)
Breaking down complex problems into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations (Memoization/Tabulation).



### 🔀 Sorting Algorithms
From basic Bubble Sort to advanced Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
